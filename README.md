## ✨ Design Direction & Principles

[span_6](start_span)Our redesign is guided by the core principles of Material You 3, focusing on creating a more personal, adaptive, and expressive interface[span_6](end_span).

### [span_7](start_span)Key Transformation Areas[span_7](end_span)
* **Layouts**: From rigid and static layouts to organic, flowing designs.
* **[span_8](start_span)Color**: From flat, generic colors to dynamic, adaptive palettes that respond to the user's wallpaper[span_8](end_span).
* **[span_9](start_span)Interactions**: From basic UI elements to delightful micro-animations and haptic feedback[span_9](end_span).
* **[span_10](start_span)[span_11](start_span)Personalization**: From a one-size-fits-all experience to a personalized and context-aware interface[span_10](end_span)[span_11](end_span).


### Color & Typography
[span_12](start_span)The new design system uses a primary palette of **Teal** and a secondary palette of **Amber** to maintain brand consistency, while leveraging Material You's dynamic color system for personalization[span_12](end_span). [span_13](start_span)Typography is built on the **Google Sans** family, using varied weights and sizes to create a clear visual hierarchy[span_13](end_span).

## 📱 Key Screen Redesigns

The core user experience has been reimagined across all major screens:

* **[span_16](start_span)Homework**: A card-based grid layout uses icons, color-coding, and interactive toggles to make tracking assignments easy and efficient[span_16](end_span).
* **[span_17](start_span)Grades**: Data visualization is used to display grades, showing trend lines, overall averages, and performance insights for each subject[span_17](end_span).

## 🛠️ Implementation & Technology

The redesigned application will be built as a native Android app using a modern technology stack.

* **[span_18](start_span)Language**: **Kotlin**[span_18](end_span)

* **[span_20](start_span)Architecture**: A clean, scalable architecture with a three-level information hierarchy (main sections, subsections, detail views)[span_20](end_span).

### [span_21](start_span)Development Timeline[span_21](end_span)
1.  **Design Finalization** (2 weeks)
