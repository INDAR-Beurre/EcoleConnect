## ‚ú® Design Direction & Principles

The redesign is guided by the core principles of Material You 3 Expressive, focusing on creating a more personal, adaptive, and expressive interface.

### Key Transformation Areas
* From rigid layouts to organic, flowing designs.
* From flat colors to dynamic, adaptive palettes.
* From basic interactions to delightful micro-animations.
* From a generic UI to personalized experiences.

### Color & Typography
The design system uses a primary palette of Teal and a secondary palette of Amber as the default theme for brand consistency. It leverages Material You's dynamic color system to adapt to user wallpapers
